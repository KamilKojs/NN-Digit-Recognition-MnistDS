# Overview
This is the code for the "NN-Digit-Recognition-MnistDS" app written in Java. Gui was built in Java Swing. The app uses custom Neural Network and Matrix library built from scratch. The point of building these libraries myself was to understand inside out how neural networks work.
To train neural network MNIST dataset was used.
